## Topics Covered
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**
  - Regular expressions are a fast and powerful way to interact with strings
- **Destructive vs Non-destructive methods**

## Goals
- Implement Regex methods in Python
- Understand the difference between a destructive method and a non-destructive method

## Lesson

### Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Regular Expressions, or regex, is the ability to use patterns to match character combinations. While every language has slightly different patterns to match these combinations, they fundamentally work the same
- It basically works like this:
  - A user inputs some text
  - Your compiler, using whatever language you decide, reads that input and pattern-matches it.
  - If it passes, do one thing. If it does not, do something else
- This is useful for something like phone number inputs or social security methods because people are terrible at putting their information into a form
  - For phone numbers, some people use parenthesis, others use periods, others use dashes, and others don't have any delimeters
  - Regex helps with this because they look for consistent patterns. In our case, we just want the numbers associated with a phone number input and to ignore the rest of the characters
- It's recommended for you to use `raw strings` instead of regular Python strings by prepending your string with `r` (e.g., `r("Hello\n\n")`). These raw strings will interpret the escaped characters as literally escaped characters, rather than Python's usual treatment of them as new line characters. **Let's get started on this**:
```python
import re # stands for Regular Expressions and brings in the Python re library into this file
## re.search() will search a string you pass in to see if it matches the regex pattern you have
string = 'June 24'
regex_pattern = r"([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+)" # any combination of letters, capital or not, followed by a space, followed by a digit of any length
print(re.search(regex_pattern, string)) # returns a `match` object with the thing that's matched up. This matches anywhere in the string
print(re.match(regex_pattern, string)) # same as above, but this matches the string starting from the beginning. only returns the first match
print(re.findall(regex_pattern, 'June 24 August 1 December 22')) # this returns a list of all matches
```
- Another example:
```python
import re
regex = r"[a-zA-Z]+ \d+"
matches = re.findall(regex, "June 24, August 9, Dec 12")
for match in matches:
    print(f"Full match: {match}")

## Find and replace
## replaced_string = re.sub(pattern, replacement_pattern, input_str, count, flags=0)
regex = r"([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+)"

print(re.sub(regex, r"\2 of \1", "June 24, August 9, Dec 12")) # 24 of June, 9 of August, 12 of Dec
```

**Destructive vs. Non-destructive Methods**
- In every language, there are destructive and non-destructive methods. Destructive methods are those that change the original data where non-destructive methods are those that do not change the original data. You have to be careful with the methods that you use as there isn't a clear indication in Python or JS as to which are destructive and which aren't. Let's take a look at the example below:
```python
first_name = 'jonathan'
first_name.capitalize() # this is a string method that converts the first character to upper case
first_name # we see that despite running the method above, my original data does not change

last_name = 'young'
last_name.replace('g', '123')
last_name # same case here - this is a non destructive method

staff = ['jon', 'rod', 'ankur', 'chad', 'alicia']
staff.append('tom')
staff # this is a destructive method because it alters the original
## Let's fire tom. He sucks.
staff.pop()
staff # my original has been changed yet again!
```
