# Weekly Topic
- ### Git Version Control basics 
- ### Github
- ### Test Driven Development (TDD)

# Why is it important?
- ### Git helps you create different 'save points' in your application.
- ### Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. 
- ### Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project. This allows multiple people to work on the same files at the same time.
- ### Github allows you to host code repositories on the web instead of just on your local machine. Companies host their code on Github (and others) and you'll have to learn how to use it. 
- ### TDD helps you think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code.
