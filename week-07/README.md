# Weekly Topics:
- Django CRUD apps
- Third-party APIs (Application programming interface)
- Assessment #4 at end of the week!

# Why is it important?
- CRUD (create, read, update, delete) applications are incredibly popular and are used extensively. If you've ever used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, or any other website that takes advantage of reading and writing posts into persistent storage, then you've used a CRUD website. Most websites you build as a developer are going to be CRUD based.
- More Django practice will come in handy when you're building the backend of your final projects.
- Third-party APIs decrease the work you have to do as a programmer (which we're always striving for) and allow you to seamlessly read and write data to third-party apps.

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. Use Django's admin dashboard to easily perform CRUD actions.
3. Register and work with URLs.
4. Implement third-party CSS into apps.
5. Template HTML/CSS to be continuously used.
6. Write safe authentication techniques (logging in and logging out) for our apps.
7. Write nested CRUD applications.
8. Implement third-party APIs into apps.
9. Read, analyze, and display data from APIs.
10. Quickly write a simple CRUD interface from memory using all the tools we've learned to date.

# Behavioral Question of the Week:
- "Tell me about a time that you failed"
