# CRUD in Django

The majority of code you write professionally for the web will actually share a striking familiarity: it will be focused on performing the same handful of operations on a record in the database. There are a million tiny variations on how this will happen, but at the core, there are only four major operations we'll perform on our data.

In the web world we call this a CRUD app. That is, it has four essential functions:

1. Creating new records
2. Retrieving records
3. Updating existing records
4. Deleting existing records

Twitter is a CRUD app. Instagram is a CRUD app. Salesforce is a CRUD app, and so is Amazon. This pattern is so important, that we're going to spend a big chunk of our week praticing building them. You need to be able to write a simple CRUD interface from memory quickly, so that you can focus on the individual features that differentiate each product.

## Setup
Today, we're going to create a CRUD app for books in a library. Let's start by setting up our project and app:
```bash
$ django-admin startproject my_project
$ cd my_project
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install django
$ ./manage.py startapp books
```
We have a project called `my_project` and an app called `books`. Remember that a project can have many apps and an app can be ported into many projects. Picture Amazon's business model. Amazon has many sources of revenue/business (`projects` in Django). Each one of those `projects` has different apps that it uses. For example, Amazon Video Streaming allows you to order on-demand videos using a `video` app. They will then charge you using their `orders` app and associate a digital order with your account. That same `orders` app associates physical orders with your account and charges you just the same. A project has many apps and an app can be used in many projects.

To register our app with our project, we need to add it to `my_project/settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'books',
]
```

Next, we need to create the Model (Python class that connects directly into the database) in `books/models.py`:
```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pages = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Book {self.id}: Title: {self.title}"
```

Our Book model has a book `title` and a number of `pages`. Let's create the migration and migrate it to the database:

```bash
$ ./manage.py makemigrations
$ ./manage.py migrate
```

Once we've got that in the database, let's define the possible routes a user can go to in `books/urls.py`:
```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.book_list, name='book_list'),
    path('<int:book_id>', views.book_view, name='book_view'),
    path('new', views.book_create, name='book_new'),
    path('edit/<int:book_id>', views.book_update, name='book_edit'),
    path('delete/<int:book_id>', views.book_delete, name='book_delete'),
]
```

These routes are registered under the application, but we need to associate it back with the project in `my_project/urls.py`:

```python
# add this on top
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('books/', include('books.urls')),
]
```

Next, in our `books/views.py`, we need to create the controller code that will do all the heavy lifting once a user actually hits a URL in `books/urls.py`:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404
from django.forms import ModelForm

from books.models import Book

class BookForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'pages']

def book_list(request, template_name='books/book_list.html'):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    data = {'all_books': books}
    return render(request, template_name, data)

def book_view(request, book_id, template_name='books/book_detail.html'):
    book = get_object_or_404(Book, id=book_id)
    data = {'book': book}
    return render(request, template_name, data)

def book_create(request, template_name='books/book_form.html'):
    form = BookForm(request.POST or None)
    if form.is_valid():
        form.save()
        return redirect('book_list')
    return render(request, template_name, {'form': form, 'new_or_edit': 'New'})

def book_update(request, book_id, template_name='books/book_form.html'):
    book = get_object_or_404(Book, id=book_id)
    form = BookForm(request.POST or None, instance=book)
    if form.is_valid():
        form.save()
        return redirect('book_list')
    return render(request, template_name, {'form' :form, 'new_or_edit': 'Edit'})

def book_delete(request, book_id, template_name='books/book_confirm_delete.html'):
    book = get_object_or_404(Book, id=book_id)    
    if request.method=='POST':
        book.delete()
        return redirect('book_list')
    return render(request, template_name, {'object':book})
```

Finally, let's create the templates themselves so that we have code to look at on the screen. We'll be creating 4 views: 
1. `books/templates/books/book_list.html`
```html
<h1>Books</h1>

<table border="1">
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Pages</th>
    <th>View</th>
    <th>Edit</th>
    <th>Delete</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    {% for book in all_books %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ book.title }}</td>
            <td>{{ book.pages }}</td>
            <td><a href="{% url "book_view" book.id %}">view</a></td>
            <td><a href="{% url "book_edit" book.id %}">edit</a></td>
            <td><a href="{% url "book_delete" book.id %}">delete</a></td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</tbody>
</table>

<a href="{% url "book_new" %}">New</a>
```
2. `books/templates/books/book_detail.html`
```html
<h1>Book Details</h1>
<h2>Title: {{ book.title }}</h2>
Pages: {{ book.pages }}
<hr/>
<a href="{% url "book_list" %}">Back</a>
```

3. `books/templates/books/book_form.html`
```html
<h1>Book Form: {{ new_or_edit }}</h1>
<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

4. `books/templates/books/book_confirm_delete.html`
```html
<h1>Book Delete</h1>
<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}
    Are you sure you want to delete "{{ object.title }}" ?
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

Lastly, run `$ ./manage.py runserver` from your command line and see your work!
