## Topics Covered
- Django Authentication
    - Authentication (logging in and out) is an important feature for any web app. It allows users to store data private to them and blocks anonymous users from viewing protected routes

## Goals
**Core**
- Adding sign up functionality to your web apps
- Adding log in functionality to your web apps
- Understand Django's authentication methods

## Lesson
- Up to this point, we haven't had the ability to log in or out of our application. We're going to start implementing sign up, log in, and log out with help from [WS Vincent](https://wsvincent.com/django-user-authentication-tutorial-login-and-logout/).

- On your desktop, create a project called `my_project` and do your usual Django setup:
```sh
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install django
$ django-admin startproject my_project
$ cd my_project
$ python manage.py migrate
```

- This is the same series of commands you've run for the past few days (i.e., you haven't done anything new), but if you look inside `settings.py`'s `INSTALLED_APPS`, there is a `'django.contrib.auth'` library that comes for free. This preinstalled library gives you much of the functionality of authentication that you need.

- To get the routes for authentication, go inside `my_project/urls.py` and add this code:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
]
```

- That one extra line of code for `accounts/` gives us the following URLs:
```
accounts/login/ [name='login']
accounts/logout/ [name='logout']
accounts/password_change/ [name='password_change']
accounts/password_change/done/ [name='password_change_done']
accounts/password_reset/ [name='password_reset']
accounts/password_reset/done/ [name='password_reset_done']
accounts/reset/<uidb64>/<token>/ [name='password_reset_confirm']
accounts/reset/done/ [name='password_reset_complete']
```

- Like normal routes, we need templates. With that let's create `templates/registration/login.html` at the same level as `my_project` and `manage.py` (i.e., not within `my_project`) to get started:
```html
<h2>Login</h2>
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

- We usually use templates within apps, but since this `accounts` functionality is at the project level, we have to have a templates folder at the project level. We also need to register these templates in `settings.py`:

Django Version 3.1
```python

## under templates section
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],
        ...
    },
]

## at the bottom of the file
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
```
**Note:** If you're using Django version 2.1 use `'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],` and `import os` at the top of the `settings.py` file instead of `'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],`

- Just like yesterday, we want to create a base template and a homepage template that will be rendered before we do anything. First, in `my_project/urls.py`, add this code:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView # new

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='home.html'), name='home'), # new
]
```

- Next, in the `templates/` folder you created (not within the registration folder), create two additional files. First, `base.html`:

```html
<!-- templates/base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{% block title %}Django Auth Tutorial{% endblock %}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      {% block content %}
      {% endblock %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
and `home.html`:
```html
<!-- templates/home.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Home{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% if user.is_authenticated %}
    Hi {{ user.username }}!
    <p><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">logout</a></p>
  {% else %}
    <p>You are not logged in</p>
    <a href="{% url 'login' %}">login</a>
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

- Now, let's edit `templates/registration/login.html` to use our base:
```html
<!-- templates/registration/login.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Login{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <h2>Login</h2>
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```

- If you visit http://localhost:8000/accounts/login, you'll see a login page that comes for free. Before we can login, however, we'll need a user:
```sh
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- Try logging in! But wait, how do we log out? Let's add this into `settings.py` at the very bottom:
```python
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'
```
- And just like that, we can log in and out! Take a breather before jumping into signing up a user in the next section.

**Sign Up**
- For this section, we're going to need to create our own view and url for signup. As a result, we'll create our own dedicated app called `accounts`:

```sh
$ python manage.py startapp accounts
```

- Register this in `settings.py` as an `INSTALLED_APP`:
```python
'accounts',
```

- Next, in `my_project/urls.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='home.html'), name='home'),
]
```

- Let's get `accounts/urls.py` set up:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('signup/', views.SignUp.as_view(), name='signup'),
]
```

- As we see in `urlpatterns`, we need to set up our `SignUp` in `views.py`:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views import generic

class SignUp(generic.CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name = 'registration/signup.html'
```

- That last line tells us that we need a `signup.html` template in `templates/registration/signup.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Sign Up{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <h2>Sign up</h2>
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
  </form>
{% endblock %}
```

- Visit http://localhost:8000/accounts/signup/, sign up, and log in! If you are interested in password reset, go through the tutorial written by WS Vincent [here](https://wsvincent.com/django-user-authentication-tutorial-password-reset/)
