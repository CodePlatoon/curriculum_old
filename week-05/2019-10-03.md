## Front End HTML/CSS/JS

We were introduced to HTML & CSS last week.

## HTML

HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. Everything you see on the internet is a web page of sorts and contains an HTML file.

## HTML Tag Architecture

```
<!-- index.html  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Code Platoon!</title>

  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /> <!-- A link to our style sheet  -->
  <script src="app.js" defer></script> <!-- A link to our javascript file  that will interact with our webpage -->

</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="title" >My Website</h1>
  <p class='sub-title'>Subtitle for my website</p>
  <!-- The rest of your HTML goes here  -->
</body>
</html>

```

## HTML Elements & Tags

HTML consists of __elements__ which are the building blocks to HTML pages and which are represented by HTML __tags__.
```
<!-- index.html  -->

<!-- An HTML element is the start of an HTML tag and the end of an HTML tag. -->
<h1>This is a heading tag</h1>

<!-- This is an HTML element with a button tag -->
<button>PRESS HERE</button>
```

### Basic HTML Tags

[HERE A LIST OF HTML TAGS](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp)


## HTML Attributes (__id__ & __class__)

When styling webpages with colors, fonts, sizes, and photos you will rarely apply CSS properties directly to the __element__ or __tag__.
```
<!-- index.html -->
<h1>My Website</h1>
<p>Subtitle for my website</p>
```

You will apply an __id__ or __class__ to select the desired HTML element.

```
<!-- index.html -->
<h1 id="title" >My Website</h1>
<p class='sub-title'>Subtitle for my website</p>
```

```
/* styles.css */
#title {
  font-size: 34px;
  text-align: center;
  color: #66B6FF
}

.sub-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  text-align: center
}
```

## How do we know what tags to use and where they go? (Wire Framing/Boxing)

Below is a static webpage that we want to replicate in HTML. Before we just jump right into writing out HTML file let develop a visual plan on what tags and elements we need to use.

Using a piece of paper, we draw a box where each incapsulating tag should go for the below static webpage.


![Basic HTML Webpage](https://github.com/julietplatoon/curriculum/blob/master/week-05/images/html_static_page.png)


__Boxing example:__
Every single box will be a __tag__ within your HTML `<body>` __element__.

![Boxing Examples](https://github.com/julietplatoon/curriculum/blob/master/week-05/images/boxing.png)

__Boxing to HTML example:__

```
<!-- index.html  -->
-> HTML Head Tag goes here
<body>
  <nav>
    <p>Company Name</p>
    <div>
      <p>FEATURES</p>
      <p>ENTERPRISE</p>
      <p>SUPPORT</p>
      <button>Login</button>
    </div>
  </nav>

  <!-- ... The rest of your HTML -->

</body>

```

## Using Javascript to interact with your web page (The Document Object Model or DOM)

Javascript is the programming language of the web. Javascript can update and change both the HTML and CSS of your webpage. __It can also perform calculations, manipulate, and validate data.__

For example: When you enter your name into a form, Javascript will be running code in the background to validate the form.

### __Using Javascript to select HTML tags__

In the HTML File we want to use a `<script>` element to use our Javascript file within the web page. You can either put your `<script>` within the `<head>` element, where the `<title>` element is also located or at the end of the `<body>` element. Include a `src=` attribute and put it equal to the location of your Javacript file in relation to the `index.html` file.
```
<!-- index.html  -->
<head>
  <!-- other Tags (title, link, meta, etc)  -->
  <script src="app.js" async defer></script>
</head>
```

The `defer` attribute within the `<script>` element indicates to the browser to execute this script after the DOM 'web page' has been parsed.

__Our `index.html` page__

Create an `index.html` file and copy the below code into your html file.
```
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title></title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <script src="app.js" async defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id='alert-button' >Alert Me!</button>

  </body>
</html>
```

Next, create an `app.js` file and copy the below code into your Javascript file.
```
// app.js

document.getElementById('alert-button').onclick = () => {
  return alert("Hello Code Platoon!")
}
```

__To access your webpage's `document` in Javascript and gain access to you HTML elements and tags, in your JS file use the `document.` + *someMethod* to perform specific actions on your web page.__

Examples:
* [document.getElementById()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
* [document.getElementByClassName()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName)

[Other Document Object Properties and Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp)

__To open your HTML file in the browser, in your terminal type the following command:__

`$ open index.html`

## Chrome Dev Tools `cmd + option + i`

Google Chrome has built in Developer Tools to assist developers to see what's going on in your HTML and Javascript in the webpage.

__Shortcut to Open Chrome's Developer Tools: `cmd + option + i`__
