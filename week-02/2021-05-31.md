## Topics Covered
- **Object Oriented Programming**
  - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a commonly used design paradigm. Python is an object oriented language, and so OOP is an essential piece of understanding Python.
- **Classes**
  - Classes are structures in code that allow for developers to create more elaborate data types that can better reflect real-world objects
- **Instance Attributes -vs- Class Attributes**
  - Understanding the different types of variables to use in Class objects is important since your program's functionality is dependent on the types of variables you use

## Goals
- Understand the purpose and utility of OOP
- Instantiate objects in Python with custom variables and methods
- Differentiate class variables and instance variables

## Lesson
**Object Oriented Programming in Python**
- Python is an object-oriented programming language where everything is an object (i.e., booleans, strings, hashes, arrays, integers, everything)
- Objects are data structures that have *attributes* and *methods*. Think of objects as nouns. Most nouns have attributes (adjectives) and methods that it can do (verbs)
  - For example, imagine you have a dog. Every dog has attributes such as: breed, weight, and color. Every dog also has methods that it can do such as: sit, fetch, and lay down
- Objects are organized by `class`-es. Classes are used to combine how data is represented and methods to manipulate data
- Before we get started, `help(object_here)` will give you a bit of information on what type of object you're dealing with and some methods that are available to call on it
  - You'll also see methods with double underscores `__`. Those are called `dunder` methods and you can read more about them [here](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_magic_methods.php)

- Features of OOP:
  - Inheritance = Sharing of similar features and attributes
  - Polymorphism = Objects can take different forms depending on needs/situation
  - Abstraction = Logic/Complexity is hidden, for simplicity
  - Encapsulation = Data access can be restricted based on needs

**Classes Introduction**
- Creating a class is as simple as the following:
```python
class Dog:
    pass

fido = Dog() # this is how we instantiate our Dog instance
print(fido) # this doesn't really show us anything useful
```

- The Dog class above isn't very interesting tho. Let's make it more useful, but adding in attributes (variables specific to a class/instance) and methods (functions specific to a class/instance):
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis Lupus Familiaris" # example of a *class attribute*
    sound = "Woof"
    legs = 4

    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name # example of an *instance attribute*
        self.breed = breed

    def __str__(self):
        return f"I am a dog named {self.name} and my breed is {self.breed}. I have {self.legs} legs and I say {self.sound}!"

    def speak(self): # example of an *instance method*
        print(self.sound)

fido = Dog("fido", "Pointer") # create an instance of Dog, with some attributes
fido.speak()
print(fido) # much more descriptive output! This comes from the __str__() instance method
```

**Instance Attributes -vs- Class Attributes**
- Instance attributes are variables that are unique to each instance of a class that is created
- Class attributes are variables that are shared between ALL instances of a class that are created

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis Lupus Familiaris" # all dogs have the same species type => class attribute
    legs = 4

    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name # each dog has a unique name => instance attribute

fido = Dog("fido")
lassie = Dog("lassie")

print(fido.name)
print(fido.species)

print(lassie.name)
print(lassie.species)
```
