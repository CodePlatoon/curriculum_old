# Why is it important?
- OOP is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects
- Understanding OOP is important to know how to structure and break down problems & is used a lot in Python
- Every application relies on persistent data.
- Data is everywhere and you'll need to know how to create, read, update, and delete data from a persistent data source.
- CSV files are the most commonly used type of data persistent source for business people (think excel)

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. Create Objects using OOP
2. Utilize OOP Inheritance to extend the usage of your Objects
3. Create, Read, Write, and Delete from a CSV file

# Breakout Sessions
1. OOP Review
2. Working with CSVs
3. Anything else...
