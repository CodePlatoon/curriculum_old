## Topics Covered
- **React**
  - Continue to build upon News Site React Challenge.
- **Tokens**
  - Tokens are used to authenticate users to ensure every request sent to the backend is from a varified user.

## Goals
**Core**
 - Understand what tokens are used for.
 - Build a login page that uses Token Authentication.

## Lesson
**Tokens**
  - Token authentication is a string of random letters and numbers that is sent back from the server upon a successfull user login.
  - The Token is passed in with the HTTP request and the server would attempt to verify the token and if successfull would continue processing the request. If the server could not verify the token, the server would send a `401 Unauthorized` message back to the user.
  - There are multiple different libraries and modules that create the Tokens for us to use in our application.
