# Weekly Topics:
- Connecting our Django API to our React frontend
- Individual projects

# Why is it important?
- Separating our frontend and backend allows for elegant code organization and easy scalability, allowing us to work on the frontend or backend without having to modify the other.

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. Access Django backends through React frontends to create a full-fledged web application.
2. More practice deploying web applications to Heroku.
3. Have a better understanding of the inner workings of full web apps and build them more efficiently.

# Individual Project:
- The individual project will be your last assessment of the course, assessment #5. It'll push your creativity and technical skills, preparing you for your group capstone project, and for your professional life outside of the cohort.
- You will be required to write a full-stack web app, including nested CRUD, routing, testing, and at least 2 3rd party APIs. Here are the full requirements: {TO DO: ADD RUBRIC FOR ASSESSMENT #5}
- For inspiration, take a look at this compiled list of public 3rd party APIs: [Github list of 3rd Party APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) & [API & React Library Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G3Mu5WBk28_SYQsmOaYWIn6C4Wk21SOSGKrvnJstN1I/edit?usp=sharing)
