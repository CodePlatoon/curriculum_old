# Schema SQL

Now that you've designed & revised the schema for three different applications, write a SQL script to create the matching schema in Postgresql.

Choose **two** of the three schemas you've designed. Create different databases for each schema and separate `create_schema.sql` scripts for each database.

Verify your schema using the `\d` command in the Postgresql console (`psql`). Also, for each table, write an `INSERT` query to verify your table is setup as expected.
