# Why is it important?
- HTML is the foundation of all web pages; without HTML, you wouldn’t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your web pages and thus it is essential for any job in web development. 
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed, determining the layout, font, color, and any other aesthetic choices for your web pages and thus is key in determining how users will interact with your pages and important knowledge for work as a web developer. 
- Javascript is the primary language of the web and allows us to determine the behavior of web pages by accessing and modifying HTML and CSS elements. Most web pages are designed to allow the user to interact with the site and this is implemented by programmers using JS. 

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:

2. Determine the exact layout and style of web pages using CSS 
3. Use JS to access individual elements of web pages
4. Understand and modify web pages using Chrome Developer Tools to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM)
5. Design and build web pages that respond to user's behavior by loading JS in HTML
6. (pending move...) Use Asynchronous JS and the Fetch API to get data from and post data to web pages
