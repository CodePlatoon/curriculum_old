## Lesson

**Basic React**

Let's walk through a challenge called [Mute Button](https://github.com/oscarplatoon/mute-button) together. Through this process we will get a refresher on `state`, learn about React component `props`, and begin using functional components.

To summarize the challenge's `original_readme`, we are trying to toggle between two different images on the page based on a user's clicks. The images can be found in the `icons` folder.

After cloning our app down and `cd`-ing into that repo, we are going to make it a React app by running `create-react-app app` and dragging the contents of our `app` folder into our original `mute-button` folder. Please keep the `README` from `mute-button` instead of `app`.

Your file structure should look like this:<br/>

Starting out, we're going to hop into our `App.js`. As a review from yesterday, let's refactor this slightly to start with a class-based component. We'll need to set our `state` to control whether that variable has been clicked or not:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    isMuted: false // let's just set it to false to begin with
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

Next, we will create a function called `toggleMute` that we'll attach to an event handler `onClick` for the image:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    isMuted: false // let's just set it to false to begin with
  };

  toggleMute = () => {
    this.setState({
      isMuted: !this.state.isMuted // opposite of whatever it is currently set as
    });
  }

  render() {
    console.log(this.state) // what is state before it hits the onClick?
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <button onClick={ this.toggleMute }>test</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Let's run this and see what happens in the console - you should see `state` changing every time you click the `test` text on the screen.

Now, let's create another component to handle the mute button. Similar to Django, if you have a bunch of the same thing (i.e., models, migrations, templates, views), then we want to have them in their own separate folder. For us, we'll create a `components` folder under `src`. Each specific component will have its own folder, and inside that folder will be the component itself and the corresponding test file.

We're going to create `src/components/MuteButton/MuteButton.js` with the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MuteButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    if (this.props.isMuted === true) {
      return (
        <button> ON </button> // just getting some text on the screen for now
      );
    }

    return (
      <button> OFF </button>
    );
  }
}

export default MuteButton;
```

But wait... what is `this.props`? Since our `MuteButton` extends React's `Component` class, it has access to an object known as `props`. `props` stands for "properties" and is an object used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. In this case, we are anticipating that `MuteButton` will be a child component rendered by the parent component `App`, and that `App` will pass along the data `isMuted` down to `MuteButton`.

So with that, let's import our `MuteButton` component into `App.js` and call it in the render (the same way we would include an HTML element):

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import MuteButton from './components/MuteButton/MuteButton';

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    isMuted: false // let's just set it to false to begin with
  };

  toggleMute = () => {
    this.setState({
      isMuted: !this.state.isMuted // opposite of whatever it is currently set as
    });
  };

  render() {
    console.log(this.state); // what is state before it hits the onClick?
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <MuteButton isMuted={ this.state.isMuted } />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Notice how we're passing `isMuted` down to the `MuteButton` when we render it. With the way we created it, the `MuteButton` component itself does not have any state, so it relies on `isMuted` being set at the parent component level and passed down.

Oh no - we lost the click functionality! Fear not - similar to how we passed `isMuted`, we also need to pass the `toggleMute` function so that when the component is clicked it actually fires the event. That being said, event handlers cannot be directly attached to React components (i.e. we can't just put attach an `onClick` to our `MuteButton` in `App`). Instead, we need to pass the entire function with the context of `App.js` down to `MuteButton`:

```javascript
// inside App.js
<MuteButton isMuted={ this.state.isMuted } toggleMute={ this.toggleMute } />
```

The final `App.js` should now look like this:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import MuteButton from './components/MuteButton/MuteButton';

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    isMuted: false // let's just set it to false to begin with
  };

  toggleMute = () => {
    this.setState({
      isMuted: !this.state.isMuted // opposite of whatever it is currently set as
    });
  };

  render() {
    console.log(this.state); // what is state before it hits the onClick?
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <MuteButton isMuted={ this.state.isMuted } toggleMute={ this.toggleMute } />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Now that `toggleMute` is being passed down to our child component, we can access it via the `this.props` object and attach it to some `onClick` handlers. `MuteButton.js` should read something like:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MuteButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    if (this.props.isMuted === true) {
      return (
        <button onClick={ this.props.toggleMute }> ON </button> // just getting some text on the screen for now
      );
    }

    return (
      <button onClick={ this.props.toggleMute }> OFF </button>
    );
  }
}

export default MuteButton;
```

At this point, you should be able to toggle between `OFF` and `ON` quite easily. Our final step is to display the image instead of the text on the page. We first need to move the entire `icons` folder into `src` as that is where everything is compiled from. You can import images just like you would React components.

`MuteButton.js` should now look like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import OnIcon from '../../icons/on.svg';
import OffIcon from '../../icons/off.svg';

class MuteButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    if (this.props.isMuted === true) {
      return (
        <button onClick={ this.props.toggleMute }>
          <img src={ OffIcon } alt='AudioOff' />
        </button>
      );
    }

    return (
      <button onClick={ this.props.toggleMute }>
        <img src={ OnIcon } alt='AudioOn' />
      </button>
    );
  }
}

export default MuteButton;
```

That's it! We can click the image it toggles between muted and not muted.

**Refactoring**

Now that we have our code functioning, let's clean it up a bit. In our `MuteButton` component, the only thing that really changes in the render is the image, which is dependent on `this.props.isMuted`. Since this is JSX, we can slim down our code a bit using a ternary operator to determine which image to render:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import OnIcon from '../../icons/on.svg';
import OffIcon from '../../icons/off.svg';

class MuteButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={ this.props.toggleMute }>
        { this.props.isMuted === true ?
          <img src={OffIcon} alt='AudioOff' />
          : <img src={OnIcon} alt='AudioOn' /> }
      </button>
    );
  }
}

export default MuteButton;
```

**Destructuring**

If we have a lot of props getting passed down, it gets ugly because we have to write `this.props` so many times. Because `this.props` is a javascript object, we can use a concept called [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to declare new variables like this:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  "city": "Chicago",
  "school": "Code Platoon",
  "numberOfStudents": 11,
  "somethingWeDontNeed": "lorem ipsum"
};

const { city, school, numberOfStudents } = myObject;
// Javascript will look inside of myObject to find keys that match up with the variables you've declared in curly braces and set them equal to them

city // "chicago"
school // "Code Platoon"
numberOfStudents // 11
// Note: if we tried to access somethingWeDontNeed, it would be undefined as we didn't include it in the destructure
```
Let's apply this syntax within the `render()` function of our `MuteButton` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import OnIcon from '../../icons/on.svg';
import OffIcon from '../../icons/off.svg';

class MuteButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { isMuted, toggleMute } = this.props;
    return (
      <button onClick={ toggleMute }>
        { isMuted === true ?
          <img src={OffIcon} alt='AudioOff' />
          : <img src={OnIcon} alt='AudioOn' /> }
      </button>
    );
  }
}

export default MuteButton;
```
There, that's easier to read!

**Functional Components and the `useState` Hook**

While class components do provide a lot of great built-in functionality, they also include a lot of bloat that is not necessary for all components (for example, in upcoming lessons, we'll dig into class component lifecycle methods, which we haven't needed to use yet). Because of this, in their release of React 16.8, the developers at Facebook unveiled a new concept, [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), which allow us to use state and other React features in a functional component (i.e. without having to extend the `React.Component` class).

While the use of functional components and hooks does usually simplify our code, a large number of legacy React codebases still have a lot of class-based components as well, so it's _very_ important that we get comfortable with both. To that end, when going through these React challenges, if time permits, it is always good to re-write your component(s) in the other style (i.e. if we start with a class component and time permits, go back and refactor as a functional component). Below is what the `App` and `MuteButton` code would look like with purely functional components:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import MuteButton from './components/MuteButton/MuteButton';

function App() {
  const [ isMuted, setIsMuted ] = useState(false);

  const toggleMute = () => {
    setIsMuted(!isMuted);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MuteButton isMuted={ isMuted } toggleMute={ toggleMute } />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```javascript
// MuteButton.js
import React from 'react';
import OnIcon from '../../icons/on.svg';
import OffIcon from '../../icons/off.svg';

const MuteButton = (props) => {
  const { isMuted, toggleMute } = props;
  return (
    <button onClick={ toggleMute }>
      { isMuted === true ?
        <img src={OffIcon} alt='AudioOff' />
        : <img src={OnIcon} alt='AudioOn' /> }
    </button>
  );
}

export default MuteButton;
```

Things to note in this refactor to functional components:
- Functional components are just functions, so they can be created using the `function` keyword (as in `App.js`) or as arrow functions declared in a variable (as in `MuteButton.js`).
- Functional components do NOT have a `render` method; they just return the JSX to be rendered.
- `props` - whatever is passed down to a child functional component can be accessed via the `props` parameter (note: you can _technically_ name this param whatever you want, but it is best practice to name it `props`).
- `useState` - this is the first React hook that we will be using. In this example, we've explicity imported it from the React library, but just as we saw with `React.Component`, we can also access it using `React.useState`. `useState` is a method that takes in the default state for the property you are creating and returns an array of two things:
1. the variable that will hold that piece of state (in this case, our `isMuted` boolean)
2. a method that will allow us to set that state.

Notice that we are destructuring the array that `useState` returns:
```javascript
const [ isMuted, setIsMuted ] = useState(false);
```
We can technically name these variables whatever we want, but the best practice is to name your state variable and then name the set method as `set<variableName>`. In this line, we are telling `useState` to set `isMuted` to `false` as the default. If we didn't pass anything to `useState()`, `isMuted` would begin as `undefined`.
Then in our `toggleMute` function, we use `setIsMuted` to change the state of `isMuted`.

## Assignments
Quick note on today's assignments: `Whack-A-Mole` and `Mad Lib` have React starter code for you. When you clone the repos, be sure to run `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies. You will notice that the original code uses React class components -- you are welcome to refactor them into functional components if you so choose. Keep in mind that when you are keeping track of multiple state properties in a functional component, you will declare each one independently using the `useState()` hook. (So instead of having one state object with multiple properties, each piece of state will be a variable on the scope of the functional component.)
