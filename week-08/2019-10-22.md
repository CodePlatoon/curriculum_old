### Videos (Juliet Platoon)
* [Week 8 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0CiQ7bzwETyxQsXFj_HYt9VyTViUnu8)

We are going to leave today open as a catch up and/or review day for Django concepts. There was a lot of content thrown at you and this is your day to catch your breath. We are available to do impromptu lectures as needed.

Focus mostly on the [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/julietplatoon/ticketmaster) and [Meetup](https://github.com/julietplatoon/django-meetup) challenges for today as they combine nearly all of the concepts we've been learning the last week.

If you are done, move onto a 'pick-your-own' project: make a website that uses **at least 2** third-party APIs. Need ideas? Check [here](https://rapidapi.com/?utm_campaign=easiest-api-to-learn&utm_medium=link&utm_source=quora) and [here](https://apilist.fun/)

We start React tomorrow!
